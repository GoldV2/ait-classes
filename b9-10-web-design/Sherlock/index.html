            >o Sherlock Holmes she is always <em>the</em> woman. I have seldom
            heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses
            and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any
            emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one
            particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably
            balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and
            observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would
            have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the
            softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable
            things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s
            motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such
            intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was
            to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all
            his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in
            one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than
            a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one
            woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious
            and questionable memory.

            I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away
            from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred
            interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself
            master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my
            attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his
            whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street,
            buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week
            between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the
            fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply
            attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties
            and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those
            clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as
            hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some
            vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of
            the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of
            the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission
            which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the
            reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity,
            however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily
            press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.

        <p class="tab">
            One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning
            from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil
            practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the
            well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind
            with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet,
            I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how
            he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were
            brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare
            figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was
            pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest
            and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and
            habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work
            again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon
            the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to
            the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
            His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I
            think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye,
            he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and
            indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood
            before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective
            fashion.
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
            <strong>"Wedlock suits you,"</strong> he remarked. <strong>"I think, Watson, that you have
            put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you." "Seven!"</strong> I
            answered. <strong>"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a
            trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You
            did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="tab">
            <strong>"Then, how do you know?" "I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that
            you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a
            most clumsy and careless servant girl?" "My dear Holmes,"</strong> said I,
            <strong>"this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you
            lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on
            Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my
            clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is
            incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I
            fail to see how you work it out."</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
            He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.
            <strong>"It is simplicity itself,"</strong> said he; <strong>"my eyes tell me that on the
            inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the
            leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have
            been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the
            edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you
            see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and
            that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the
            London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my
            rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver
            upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his
            top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be
            dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of
            the medical profession."</strong> I could not help laughing at the ease with
            which he explained his process of deduction. <strong>"When I hear you give
            your reasons,"</strong> I remarked, <strong>"the thing always appears to me to be so
            ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each
            successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain
            your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."</strong>
