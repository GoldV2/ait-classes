# Create a program that gathers the digits of pi starting from the index equal to the length of the user's name, then
# prompts the user to guess which digit it is, and moves on to the next digit. The program
# should record how many guesses were correct or wrong.

# 1. open pi.txt in read mode and store it in the variable "pi"
# 2. prompt for the user's name and store it in the variable "name"
# 3. find the length of "name" and store it in the variable "seed"
# 4. set the read pointer of "pi" to the value of "seed" using the .seek() attribute
# 5. initialize two counter variables with the value of 0, "correct" and "wrong"
# 6. create an infinite while loop
## inside the loop ##
    # 1. read one character from "pi" and store it in the variable "digit"
    # 2. if "digit" is equal to ".", read the next character in the file
    # 3. if "digit" is equal to "", break the loop
    # 4. prompt the user to guess a digit and store it in the variable "guess"
    # 5. if the variable "guess" is equal to "digit", display the message "Correct!" and increment the variable "correct" by 1
    # 6. if the variable "guess" is not equal to "digit", display the message "Wrong!" and increment the variable "wrong" by 1
    # 7. if the variable "guess" is not a digit, break the while loop
## outside the loop ##
# 7. After the while loop ends, print a message displaying how many guesses were correct and wrong
# 8. close "pi"
